# GEI Inventory

Construction-site inventory management for GEI. Replaces the legacy Excel
workflow with a multi-site, role-scoped, auditable web application while
preserving the Excel _feel_ that site-store workers are familiar with.

## Core principles

- **Excel-look VIEW, form-based ENTRY.** Tables mimic Excel (gridlines,
  frozen header/first column, row numbers, keyboard nav). Data entry is
  a guided form with 4–5 fields at a time. Inline grid edit is gated to
  managers only (`INVENTORY.EDIT`) and every edit captures a reason.
- **RLS is the trust boundary.** The browser talks to Supabase directly;
  every query is guarded by Postgres Row-Level Security calling
  `can_user(user_id, site_id, module, action)`. The frontend's `can()` helper
  is a UI hint, never a gate.
- **Audit is non-bypassable.** Edits to `purchases` and `issues` fire a
  Postgres trigger that writes the before/after JSON plus the actor and a
  reason into `inventory_edit_log`. A compromised client cannot skip it.
- **Multi-site from day one.** Users get a global role and per-site
  role/override assignments via `site_user_access` and
  `site_user_permission_overrides`.

## Source of truth

Before changing anything, read:

1. **Design spec** — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-gei-inventory-system-design.md`
2. **Foundation implementation plan** — `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-gei-inventory-foundation.md`
3. **Database schema** — `schema.sql`
4. **CLAUDE.md** — conventions for AI assistants working in this repo

Spec and plan are treated as living documents. Amendments go in via new
dated files under the same directories, not by rewriting history.

Why these choices — see `docs/superpowers/specs/…-design.md` §5.

## Quick start

```bash
# prerequisites: Node ≥ 20.11, pnpm ≥ 9, Supabase CLI, Docker

pnpm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local                 # (file created in a later task)
# paste Supabase + Google OAuth keys

supabase start                                    # local Postgres + Auth
pnpm db:reset                                     # applies all migrations
pnpm dev                                          # http://localhost:3000
```

> **First SUPER_ADMIN.** New Google sign-ups default to `VIEWER`. After
> your first sign-in, run this in Supabase Studio's SQL editor:
>
> ```sql
> UPDATE profiles SET role_id = 'SUPER_ADMIN' WHERE id = '<your-uid>';
> ```

## Scripts

| Command           | Purpose                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`        | Next.js dev server                       |
| `pnpm build`      | Production build                         |
| `pnpm typecheck`  | `tsc --noEmit` — must pass before commit |
| `pnpm lint`       | ESLint (flat config)                     |
| `pnpm format`     | Prettier `--write .`                     |
| `pnpm test`       | Vitest (unit + component)                |
| `pnpm test:watch` | Vitest watch mode                        |
| `pnpm e2e`        | Playwright                               |
| `pnpm db:start`   | `supabase start`                         |
| `pnpm db:reset`   | Re-apply all migrations from a clean DB  |

Husky pre-commit runs `lint-staged` + `typecheck` on every commit.

**Plans** — Foundation 24/24 ✓ · Masters 5/5 ✓ · Transactions 5/6 ✓ (golden-path e2e deferred) · Phase 2 dashboard ✓ · Phase 3 user-management ✓.

**Deferred by design**:

- Full location tree editor (drag-reorder nodes) — we ship a flat node editor that's admin-friendly enough for the MVP
- Per-permission override UI — direct SQL via Supabase Studio for now; the overrides table is in the schema and honored by `can_user()`
- Hindi / bilingual UI — `next-intl` is wired but v1 ships English-only per spec
- PDF export — browser print covers paper output

See `docs/runbooks/deploy.md` for shipping to production.

## Contributing

- Read the spec and plan before picking up a task.
- Follow TDD for any task labelled with a "Write the failing test" step.
- Every exported symbol in `lib/` gets a unit test.
- Every new RLS policy gets a test in `tests/rls/` asserting it for at
  least two roles (one allowed, one denied).
- Run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` before opening a PR.
- Commit messages follow conventional style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`,
  `docs:`, `test:`). Keep them informative — reviewers rely on them.
- Branch from `main`. Open PRs into `main`. `main` is protected after
  Task 23 ships CI.

## Deployment target

- Frontend on Vercel.
- Backend on Supabase Cloud (separate project per environment).
- Runbook lands with Phase 3 under `docs/runbooks/deploy.md`.
